Inspired by a few books/lectures (see https://smus.com/books)

- Thirteenth Tribe -- Khazar empire c. 600-1000
- Lost Enlightenment -- Islamic golden age c. 600 - 1200
- Early Middle Ages -- Great Courses focused mostly on Europe c. 300 - 1000

Also, a good excuse to play with mapbox.com and GeoJSON.
